## Synopsis

Final project containing :sparkles: 3 python files:

fresh_tomatoes.py - a prebuilt codebase used to format and display movie information to a webbrowser

media.py - my code to build a movie class to store movie informaton and provide a display method

entertainment_center.py - my code which contains the movie data, instantiates the movie objects and calls the movie display method



## Code Example
Movie objects are instantiated in "entertainment_center.py" as follows:

`godfather = media.Movie("The GodFather",
                        "A light hearted frolic into the lives of a hilarious Italian family",
                        "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1c/Godfather_ver1.jpg",
                        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY1S34973zA")
`                        
                        
Movie objects are displayed in "entertainment_center.py" as follows:

`fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies)                  
`
